# Insider Signals

A research project exploring whether SEC Form 4 insider-buy filings produce
tradeable edge for retail investors.

## Background

This project builds on an earlier gap-momentum trading system which concluded
that retail-accessible price-based signals on S&P 500 names do not produce
durable edge after costs.

The hypothesis here is different: SEC Form 4 filings — legally required
disclosures of insider transactions — may contain predictive information,
particularly for cluster buys, CEO/CFO buys, and non-routine purchases.
Academic literature (Seyhun 1986; Cohen/Malloy/Pomorski 2012) finds roughly
6% annualised alpha for opportunistic insider buys, which is both plausible
for retail and small enough to be credible.

## Research Questions

1. Does a naive "follow insider buys" strategy produce edge after costs on
   S&P 500 names in 2022–2024 backtests?
2. Do cluster buys outperform single-insider buys?
3. Does an LLM-based qualitative filter (role, context, recent news) add
   value over mechanical filtering?
4. Are holding periods of 1 week, 4 weeks, or 12 weeks optimal?

## Status

**Phase 1 — Full agent pipeline built. Backtest pipeline built. Paper trading active.**

Parallel roadmap: [Day Trading Manager Coach](DAY_TRADING_MANAGER_ROADMAP.md)
defines the planned TradingView + Alpaca workflow for a paper-first trade
manager, journal, and self-learning coaching layer.

| Agent | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Finder | `finder_agent.py` | Done |
| Filter | `filter_agent.py` | Done |
| LLM Scorer | `llm_filter_agent.py` | Done |
| Risk | `risk_agent.py` | Done |
| Reflector | `reflector_agent.py` | Done |
| Backtest | `backtest_agent.py` | Done |

### Empirical findings from initial sampling

- The scanner produces **5–18 qualifying signals per day** after all filters.
- **Cluster buys are rare (0–2 per day)** but appear higher quality — multiple
  insiders at the same company buying on the same day is a stronger signal
  than any single purchase.
- **Regional banks and financial companies dominate the signal population.**
  Small-cap financials file more Form 4 purchases than any other sector, so
  naive follow-all strategies will be heavily sector-concentrated unless an
  explicit sector cap is applied.

Next: analyse `backtest_results.csv` to compare alpha across holding periods
(1w / 4w / 12w) and test whether cluster buys carry significantly different
forward returns than single buys.

## Agent Architecture

```
finder_agent  →  filter_agent  →  llm_filter_agent  →  risk_agent  →  reflector_agent
   (EDGAR)         (signals)          (LLM scoring)      (sizing)       (log + learn)

backtest_agent  →  (finder + filter on historical dates, no LLM/trading)
```

The agents for LLM scoring, risk sizing, and order placement are implemented
end-to-end. `explore_form4.py` currently wires only the **finder → filter** leg;
the full pipeline is exercised by calling the agents directly.

### finder_agent.py

Queries EDGAR for Form 4 filings on a given date. Yields one dict per filing
that contains at least one open-market purchase (Code = P):

```
accession, ticker, company, insider, position, period, p_trades
```

Past-date results are automatically cached to `cache/edgar_raw_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
to avoid re-fetching EDGAR on reruns. Six parallel workers fetch filings
concurrently; each filing has a 30-second timeout before it is skipped.

### filter_agent.py

Receives raw trade dicts from the finder and applies the signal-quality filter
pipeline (see below). Qualifying purchases are grouped by ticker; tickers with
≥ 2 insiders buying on the same day are flagged as **cluster buys**.
Also serves as the CLI entry point when run directly.

### llm_filter_agent.py

Scores qualifying signals across five dimensions using a mix of deterministic
Python logic and GPT-4o structured output:

| Dimension | Weight | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Conviction | 25% | LLM — purchase size vs. estimated role compensation |
| Timing | 25% | LLM — buying into price weakness (contrarian) |
| Role | 20% | Deterministic — CEO/CFO/Chairman score higher |
| Cluster | 15% | Deterministic — multiple insiders amplifies conviction |
| Thesis | 15% | LLM — sector-aware valuation and context |

Each dimension scores 1–3; composite is normalised to 1–10. Signals below
`MIN_LLM_SCORE` (default 4.0) are dropped before position sizing.

### risk_agent.py

Position sizing and drawdown management via Alpaca paper-trading API:
- 1% of account equity risked per trade
- Hard stop at 10% cumulative drawdown (measured from all-time equity peak)
- Stop: 12% below entry; target: 24% above entry (2:1 R/R)
- Bracket orders (entry + stop-loss + take-profit submitted together, children GTC)

### reflector_agent.py

End-of-day trade reconciliation and LLM post-mortem:
- Persists each trade to `trade_log.json` at entry
- Reconciles exits against Alpaca bracket-leg fills at day close
- Calls GPT-4o-mini to generate coaching insights from the day's trades
- Appends daily summary to `daily_summaries.json`

### backtest_agent.py

Runs the finder+filter pipeline over historical date ranges and computes
forward returns vs. SPY at 1-week, 4-week, and 12-week horizons:
- **Phase 1 (`collect_signals`)**: iterates trading days, saves qualifying signals
  to `backtest_signals.json` incrementally. Supports `--resume` to continue
  interrupted runs and `--max-days` for smoke-tests.
- **Phase 2 (`build_results`)**: bulk-downloads prices via yfinance, computes
  alpha (signal return − SPY return) for each holding period, writes
  `backtest_results.csv`.

## Filter Pipeline

Filters applied in order inside `filter_agent.py`:

| # | Filter | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Has purchase transactions | Filing must contain at least one `Code=P` trade |
| 2 | Genuine corporate insider | Position must match known executive roles; no institutional filers |
| 3 | Valid listed ticker | 1–5 uppercase letters, no placeholders |
| 4 | Not a fund or partnership | Excludes names containing `fund`, `trust`, `lp`, `llc`, `reit`, etc. |
| 5 | Filing recency | Reporting period within `MAX_FILING_AGE_DAYS` of scan date |
| 6 | Minimum dollar size | Total purchase value ≥ `MIN_PURCHASE_VALUE` |
| 7 | Minimum stock price | Average purchase price ≥ `MIN_STOCK_PRICE` (penny stock filter) |

## Usage

```bash
# Scan + filter only (no LLM, no trading — only EDGAR_USER_AGENT needed)
python explore_form4.py
python explore_form4.py --date 2025-04-28

# Scan + filter + LLM scoring (no trading — requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
python test_llm.py --date 2025-04-28

# Day trading manager: import Alpaca paper account/orders/positions into journal
python alpaca_reconciliation.py

# Day trading manager: receive TradingView alerts locally
python tradingview_webhook.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765

# Day trading manager: local signal review and trade-plan UI
python trade_manager_ui.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787

# Backtest: collect signals over a date range and compute forward returns

## Day Trading Manager Foundation

The TradingView + Alpaca manager roadmap starts with paper-first coach files:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `trade_manager_journal.py` | Broker-independent signal inbox, trade plan validation, journal lifecycle, and daily review helpers |
| `alpaca_reconciliation.py` | Imports Alpaca paper account, positions, orders, and reconciles known journal entries by broker order id |
| `tradingview_webhook.py` | Local webhook server that validates TradingView alerts and stores them in the signal inbox |
| `trade_manager_ui.py` | Local browser UI to select signals, draft plans, run coach checks, and save journal entries |
| `trading_policy.json` | Paper-first safety policy and automation limits |
| `risk_rules.json` | Day-trading risk limits, max trades, loss streak, and reward/risk rules |
| `playbook.json` | Approved starter setups such as VWAP reclaim and opening range breakout |
| `signal_inbox.json` | Stored TradingView-style signals |
| `trade_journal.json` | Planned/open/closed manager trades |
| `manager_daily_reviews.json` | Daily coach reviews from the manager journal |
| `alpaca_account_snapshot.json` | Latest normalized Alpaca account snapshot |
| `alpaca_positions_snapshot.json` | Latest normalized Alpaca positions snapshot |
| `alpaca_orders_snapshot.json` | Latest normalized Alpaca order snapshot |
| `alpaca_reconciliation_log.json` | History of reconciliation runs |

TradingView alerts should POST JSON to `/webhook/tradingview`:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "timeframe": "5m",
  "setup": "vwap_reclaim",
  "side": "long",
  "price": 190.25,
  "trigger": "close_above_vwap",
  "notes": "High relative volume",
  "alert_id": "optional-unique-id",
  "bar_time": "optional-bar-time"
}
```

If `TRADINGVIEW_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, send the same value as the
`X-Webhook-Secret` header or as a `secret` field in the JSON body.

Open the local manager UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. It reads
`signal_inbox.json`, lets you select an alert, enter entry/stop/target, runs
the coach check, and writes the resulting plan to `trade_journal.json`.
